# **ByteForge Game Prototype**

**Purpose**:  
The **ByteForge Game Prototype** is a testing and development project created to experiment with and validate the functionalities of the **ByteForge Engine**. This project serves as a sandbox for integrating and testing various subsystems of the engine (such as memory management, logging, platform handling, and rendering) in the context of an actual game.

## **Objective**  
The goal of this project is to test and improve the engine by creating a simple game prototype. The prototype will help identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement for the engine, while also allowing for the addition of new features to the engine based on the gameâ€™s requirements.

## **Features**  
- **Engine Validation**: Test the core engine functionality such as window management, input handling, and OpenGL rendering.  
- **Subsystem Testing**: Integrate and evaluate memory, logging, and platform modules.  
- **Game Development Experimentation**: Develop a small-scale prototype to validate performance and usability.  
- **Future Integration**: As the game evolves, the project will serve as a foundation for adding and testing new features in the ByteForge Engine.  

## **Game Concept**  
The prototype will focus on creating a **simple 2D game** with the following features:  
- **Basic Rendering**: Display simple 2D assets, including backgrounds and sprites.  
- **Input Handling**: Implement keyboard or mouse inputs to control characters or objects.  
- **Basic Physics**: Implement basic object movements, collisions, and interactions.  
- **Game Loop**: Set up a basic engine loop with update and render cycles.

## **License**  
This project follows the **MIT License**. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more details.

## **Contributing**  
As the project is primarily for testing purposes, contributions are welcome to improve both the prototype and the engine.  
To contribute, please follow the standard process of forking, cloning, making changes, and submitting a pull request.
